(like the centaur that just walked by) People enjoy enhancing their avatars into creatures that dont inhabit the real world. If you see a unicorn walking by or a dragon flying overhead, you are certainly in the metaverse.<span class="comment">[paragraph break]</span>If your host could keep these anomalies out and worked to match the real world, you could live your life trapped on a false Earth. A version of Earth in the metaverse outside of your control. There are different visions of the future here.

There wouldn't need to be a digital rebellion to put them there.<span class="comment">[paragraph break]</span>The metaverse was the device that philosopher Robert Nozick referred to as an 'experience machine' in the thought experiment from his book Anarchy, State and Utopia. A machine that would allow us to only experience bliss. Robert believed that most people would decide to not plug in since they would know the experience was not real. In this dystopian vision of 2049, Robert was mistaken. Perhaps he underestimated how dystopian 2049 would become.<span class="comment">[paragraph break]</span>In this idea of the future, augmented reality glasses became as common as smartphones in the 2020s. As a result, society morphed. Buildings were bland cubes. The beauty was only viewable through the AR glasses almost everyone wore. The same was true for clothing. People simply designed virtual wardrobes, and their glasses emitted a tag corresponding to which outfit they wanted people to see. A quick touch to the temple of their AR glasses and their outfit morphed. If you were to remove your AR glasses, everyone was walking around in black spandex, past plain white buildings. It made the AR effect work better, and it was comfortable.<span class="comment">[paragraph break]</span>Homes didnt need landscaping; it was added by the AR glasses. Holiday decorations were easy. You could morph your home into a scary haunted house for Halloween or Santas workshop for Christmas.<span class="comment">[paragraph break]</span>This changed the physical world immensely. There was no need for street signs or lane markings on roads. The remaining signs were fading and in disrepair. Now, all signage, labeling, and advertising were augmented on top of the physical world. And it wasnt just advertising and directions. The real world was becoming bland. AR eliminated the need for physical decorations, beautiful color schemes, or landscaping. The beauty of new city developments was all provided through augmentation.</p><p class="indent0">If you were one of the few that still wandered into a physical store, there were no labels. The QR code on the plain cardboard box caused the box to transform into an interactive ad for the product when viewing the product through your AR glasses. With no glasses, it was a shelf full of brown cardboard boxes with QR codes. With AR glasses, it was a shelf of gleaming digital icons, floating videos, and interactive product displays. It was hard to live and work in this world without using AR.<span class="comment">[paragraph break]</span>The design of the physical world was disappearing into the AR facade. Why make anything look particularly good if you could just slap a coat of AR paint on it instead? Textures and colors gave way to black (clothing), white (buildings), and specific Pantone colors for different types of objects. All cars were a specific shade of brown. It was easier to paint the AR world on top of this strange, bland, monotone world that had blossomed. The world was now one giant green screen. At least when you werent fully inside the metaverse.<span class="comment">[paragraph break]</span>In this projected future, dependence on AR led to a dramatic increase in the use of Virtual Reality in society. In 2049, people used VR the way people used TV earlier in the century. It was the primary form of home entertainment. Just as many of the prior generation fell asleep to TV, people often just fell asleep in their virtual world, happy to be lying in a fantasy world of their own creation, away from what was becoming a more and more bland physical world, and away from the connection of physical human relationships. This was the real downfall of dystopian 2049.<span class="comment">[paragraph break]</span>Of course, you might just end up sleeping here if you can't get that suit off.&quot;<span class="quote"></span></p><p class="indent0"><span class="quote">Utopian 2049 is west of the Metaverse. </span>&quot;Technology isn't inherently bad. It has to do with how we use it. In this projected future, AR still existed, but it was only to augment the beauty of the real world, not replace it entirely. It made you less likely to peer at a sporting event through the lens of your camera. Instead, you could watch the event and still have some brief real-time statistics appear in the lower left hand corner of your field of vision. In Utopian 2049, the metaverse was here too. In this scenario, it was great for enhancing solo activities like working out, or playing video games with your far flung friends on the internet, but people still wanted to come back to their real world friends and live in the real world.<span class="comment">[paragraph break]</span>Too bad you might never be able to return!&quot;<span class="quote"></span></p><p class="indent0"><span class="quote">Future National Park is north of the Metaverse. </span>&quot;For the few remaining Luddites that shunned this strange new metaverse world of the dystopian future scenario, at least they picked up a few advantages.
